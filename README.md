# Virtualized Cybersecurity Homelab

## Overview

This project documents the design and implementation of a virtualized cybersecurity homelab built using VirtualBox.

The lab consists of:
- Kali Linux (attacker / testing machine)
- Ubuntu Linux (server / attack / testing machine)
- Windows 10 Enterprise (endpoint)

All systems are connected through an isolated NAT Network to simulate a small enterprise environment.

## Objectives

- Learn virtualization and network design
- Practice ethical hacking techniques
- Understand attacker and defender perspectives
- Build a documented portfolio for career development

## Repository Structure

- `setup/` — Operating system installation and configuration
- `networking/` — Network design and configuration
- `architecture/` — High-level lab design
- `notes/` — Experiment logs and observations
- `screenshots/` — Evidence and visual documentation
