# Account Lockout Troubleshooting

User accounts were intentionally locked to simulate common Help Desk incidents such as repeated failed login attempts.

## Actions Taken

1. I intentionally locked a user account in Active Directory
2. Attempted login from Windows 11 client
3. Identified the locked account in ADUC
4. Unlocked the user account
5. Verified successful login after unlock
